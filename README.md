# My Project: The Meat Quality Detector
I have developed an AI model, using the Jetson Nano, which detects whether meat is fresh or spoiled with camera images. This can be very helpful to home cooks, restaurant chefs, grocery store owners, and many other people across the globe, preventing sickness and diseases.
